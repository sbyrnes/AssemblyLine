AssemblyLine
============

A Docker-based build and test system for mobile applications.

Usage
------
There is no usage yet, this is still a work in progress. Be patient!

Why Assembly Line?
------
Building mobile applications is not as easy as web applications. Most independent developers design, code and build their applications entirely on their laptops. In many cases this is fine, but it would be much more convenient to have a cloud service to handle the building, testing and deploying of your mobile applications. 

Also, I wanted an excuse to learn things like Docker. =)
