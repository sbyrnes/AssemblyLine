Assembly Line Design

Preparation:
1. Spin up a new container.
2. Git pull the source code. 
--> How will the container have the right public key to verify with git?
3. Analyze the source code.
--> Static analysis plugins?

Compiling (Android):
1. Verify a build.xml is present, otherwise generate.
2. ant debug
--> Should signing of the app be supported? Hard unless you provide the key.
3. Run tests

Deploy:
1. Email link to the APK to emails. 
2. Archive APKs?
